#the algorithm were made Python3.7

*O = notation to characterize an asymptotic complexity. 

Responses for computational costs of Python programs:

task 1 -> All manipulation with "array" your computational cost is O(n) = n, because there are insertion and Search and "the for", your cost is similar O(n) = n therefore the algorithm is O(n)= 2n.

task2 -> It depends exclusively on the size of the array2, because "the for" goes from the first element to the n element. Althrough there is comparison and other instructions the cost is O(n) = n.

task3 -> This question will depend on what condition she finds, there are 3 situations:

                  1) O(n)=1, There will be no change.

           O(n) = 2) O(n) =2n, remove some caracther
   
                  3) O(n) = 2n, add some caracther.


Remove or add some caracther will do goes throught a "while" and "for". Even with different sizes the other array will be with (Blank) " ", therefore goes throught a valor of n. The sum of (n + n) while and for is iqual a 2n.


task5 -> The linked list, your insertion complexity within an ordered sequence of n is called the skip list that is a structure that allows O(n) = nlog(n).  


task7 ->Is the same of the task 5, because are same family, O(n) = nlog(n).
